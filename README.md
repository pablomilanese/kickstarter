#An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

-In this analysis we looked into Kickstarter campaigns and it's emerging trends that can better inform future fundraisers for optimal results.

Given that there was an interest to focus on plays we took a detailed look into this category.

As a first step we differentiated between Parent Categories and Subcategories. They are broken down as follows:

We found that there are 41 unique Subcategories within nine Parent Categories.

Each Parent Category has the following Subcategories:

After we combed through the data concerning theater and plays we found the following data:

We concluded that play funding did not differ much when it was paired against it's Parent Category.

On the other hand, we did find that launch dates have a significant impact on Kickstarter campaigns:

The best time of the year to launch a Kickstarter campaign will be between March and June.

It is recommended that funding campaigns are avoided in the third and fourth quarter of the year.

We also looked into the four plays you were interested and found the following:

Although Be Prepared had the biggest average donation, The Hitchhiker.. had the biggest amount of backers, which also resulted in the largest amount of funding pledged.

While looking at the performance of musicals in Great Britain we found the following data:

Although the median amount of funding goals was $4,000, the median amount of funding pledged was around $1,000.
Given this information we recommend bringing the funding goals down to around $2,000 to have a better opportunity of achieving results.
